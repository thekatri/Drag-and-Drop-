This was original Drag and Drop game done for the ArtTester project. 
It wasn't used in the end due the problems with the template they had.

The purpose is to drag picture of instrument on the right slot of the orchestral map.
The code is made on JavaScrip and used some JQuery libraries to help.
Maybe should have used bootsrap, but the drop zones and pictures were also proble. 

This project is now on hold.

I will try to come back to it and finish it for the practise, but consentrating on other things atm.
